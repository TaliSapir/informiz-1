## Information Made Accessible
[Informiz.org](http://informiz.org/) is a repository of short explanations about things. You may think of it as a graphic TL;DR version of Wikipedia, which you can embed in your website.
The informiz plugin provides your readers with instant access to those explanations - dubbed *informiz* - by associating them with text in your posts. 

Whether you blog about science, economy, technology or geopolitics - your readers shouldn't have to google for terms or names they are not familiar with.
Embedding informiz inside the text allows them to pop up any complementary information they require without ever having to leave your post. 

You can see the plugin in action on the [informiz.org](http://informiz.org/informiz-on-demand/) site.

## Installation
The informiz plugin is hosted on the [WordPress plugin directory](https://wordpress.org/plugins/informiz/).
